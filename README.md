# Diffusion and Reaction of a Species in a Diffuse Material
This repo consists of a python module developed in Phys 5070 at CU Boulder during the Spring 2021 semester. This module simulates the distribution of a species given arbitrary, spatially invariant diffusivities and arbitrary, spatially varying initial species concentrations for a specified time.
