# Diffusion and Reaction of a Species in a Diffuse Material
This repo consists of a python module developed in Phys 5070 at CU Boulder during the Spring 2021 semester. This module simulates the distribution of a species given arbitrary, spatially invariant diffusivities and arbitrary, spatially varying initial species concentrations for a specified time.

## Background
I'm in my first year of a Ph.D. in electrical engineering in [Professor Robert McLeod's research group](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/mcleod/) at CU Boulder where I work on Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (VAM). VAM is a new 3D printing technique in which images are sequentially projected in a rotating vial of photocurable resin. In one voxel of resin, if the accumulated optical dose in that voxel crosses a threshold known as the gelation threshold, t<sub>g</sub>
